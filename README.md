## Task

To create a web application... from scratch!

As per the challenge readme:

    A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point canâ€™t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

I have included a checklist below as part of tracking my progress. My comments are included where appropriate:

**WHEN I load their portfolio**
- [X] presented with the developer's name, 
- [X] a recent photo or avatar, 
- [X] links to sections about 
    - [X] them, 
    - [X] their work, 
    - [X] how to contact them

**WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation**

- [X] the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    - [X] Biography
    - [ ] Body of Work  **Note: page design makes this immediately available**
    - [X] Contact Me

**WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work**

- [ ] the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications **Page design provides this from the start**

**WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application**

- [ ] application's image should be larger in size than the others **Not complete - flexbox design proved a bit finnicky for me**

**WHEN I click on the images of the applications**

- [X] taken to that deployed application **I only have one application currently. Enjoy my ideas for the rest!**

**WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices**

- [X] presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
